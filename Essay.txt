For my extra credit script, I was trying to come up with an idea that I would keep, possibly improve upon, and actually use in my life. When brainstorming, my girlfriend suggested making a character creator for Dungeons and Dragons, as my group of friends enjoys playing when we have time. At first, I doubted the usability of it, but in the end realized that it could be a very useful program, at least to speed up character creation.
Given D&D’s use of dice, leaving a brunt of the decision making to chance, I realized that I wanted to use Python’s random function. This enables me to “roll” the stats instantly, saving a lot of time. Next, I wanted to implement a race choice, and make the appropriate stat changes per the chosen race. This part was tricky, as every race has different score increases, and one race, Half-Elf, allows a choice of two other stats to increase. This meant I needed to ask for two inputs of stats to increase, and ensure the correct stats were increased. However, I was able to implement two separate input statements, saving them to separate variables, and used an if statement to increase the corresponding stats. 
In my initial design of this script, I wanted to also include a class choice, which would take your stats and spit out more character information, such as HP. However, this required stat modifiers, which I had no way of saving separately as variables with the method I used, using a dictionary and for loop. However, I only had the basic week one and two knowledge of python. After doing the Object Oriented portion of the python class, I rewrote the script, using classes to generate character stats, races and classes. 
I have included my original script, along with a test script for the class choices, and then my final script, capable of doing all of the things I specified.
